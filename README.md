Project Idea - What is Playzer?
The goal of this project is to make an affordable open source laser tag systems that utilises an app to control game modes, teams, leaderboards and various other settings. If contributing to make this idea come to life interests you, come to me for more details.

But It Already Exists!
To some extent, yes this idea has been done before. Laser tag does exists. However if you want to play laser tag at home your options seem to be 1. Buy shitty kids toys or 2. Buy extremely expensive guns marketed to businesses. The goal is project it to make something comparable in price to nerf guns but that still has all the bells and whistles of a pro system.

The project will be open source meaning anyone with enough time should be apple to create their own games modes if they like. Theoretically the Playzer guns could be coded to match any gamemode of any gun game ever made and that is what makes this different from anything else already made.
